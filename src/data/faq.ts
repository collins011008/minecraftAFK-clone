        title: "What is ACC?",
        detail: `AFK Console Client (ACC for short) is our take on the best possible program for botting and AFK'ing on Minecraft.

We offer two different products, both aimed at improving the process of botting and AFK'ing.

The local version is our basic product, capable of most tasks you'd expect. After adding your Minecraft accounts, you can log into any server. From here you can AFK, chat, use commands, spam and much more. The web version is a cloud hosted solution, ensuring your accounts will stay online 24/7 - even with your PC turned off. The web version is also always* updated to the latest Minecraft version.`

        title: "Why should I use ACC?",
        detail: `Reasons to use the web client

Stay online 24/7 with your computer turned offf
As the web version is hosted on our servers in the cloud, you can turn off your computer at any time and your accounts will stay online.

Manage your accounts from any device
With the web client, you can access and manage your accounts from any device with a browser. Just go to our website, login and you're all set!

AFK without internet
You don't need internet to stay AFK on any server. Just log them in and go underground, they'll stay connected. You only need internet when managing your accounts, but when you've clicked connect, you can leave them be.

Use as many accounts as you want no matter your computer
Compared to the local client, you can add as many accounts as you want. Your computer/device won't be affected. No matter your hardware, you can have as many accounts online as you wish. Check our pricing page to see how many accounts each plan includes as well as the price of adding additional accounts.

Save money on electricity
Using the web client you can turn off your computer/device and your accounts will stay connected. So the days of keeping your computer running all night are over!

If you're not interested in the web version, you can always use our local client.

Here's three reasons why you should use the local ACC client, compared to normal Minecraft:

It's efficient
ACC is optimized and efficient. You can have 500+ accounts online at once using ACC depending on your hardware. ACC uses as little as 1/50th of the processing power that normal Minecraft uses.

If you're using the web version your hardware doesn't matter at all. It all runs on our end and you can access it from any device with a browser!

It's easy to use
The interface of ACC has been developed to be user friendly and intuitive to use. Compared to console based clients, you need no programming experience to use ACC.

You save power
As ACC is as efficient as it is, your computer uses way less power, ultimately saving you money on your electricity bill.

And if you're considering the web version, then you can comfortably close your computer and your accounts will stay online. You will potentially save more money on electricity alone than the cost of the client!`

        title: "What is a proxy?",
        detail: `A proxy can be explained as an IP. So you can use a proxy to get a new or additional IP. Some servers have a limit on how many accounts you may connect to their server. This limit is controlled by your IP, so you can bypass it using a proxy.

The web client comes with a proxy. So all of your accounts connect through a new IP by default (your designated private proxy). You can always add more on your own as well!`
