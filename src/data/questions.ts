        content: `The average gaming computer uses 250-400 W when running a video game. If you're keeping your computer running all night and day, that adds up to 6-9.6 kWh a day and about 180-288 kWh a month.

Power costs are usually around $0.15-$0.30 per kWh (depending on where you live). This means you're spending roughly $0.90-$2.90 a day and $27-$86 a month just to keep one gaming computer running nonstop!

        content: `Upgrading your plan is simple and fair - you only pay the difference! For instance, if you paid $3.99 for Tier 1 and want to upgrade to Tier 3 ($9.99), you'll only pay the difference: $9.99 - $3.99 = $6.00.

If you've already used half of your subscription period (about 50%), you'll only pay half of the difference - $6.00 x 50% = $3.00. This means you can upgrade for as little as $3.`

You can reach us via admin@valoks.com or our Discord server. Feel free to ask us anything, and we'll do our best to help. We also have a comprehensive help portal, where you can troubleshoot and resolve most issues independently.

Important

Before getting started, we recommend that new customers check our VPN block list in the help portal. This list identifies Minecraft servers that may require a Tier 3 plan for a stable connection.

If your server is on the list, Tier 1 might work temporarily, but an upgrade will likely be needed.
Upgrading to Tier 3 should instantly resolve connection issues. In rare cases, you may need to contact us to manually switch your IP for compatibility with your specific server.`

        title: "What is the web client?",
        content: `The web client is a cloud-hosted solution for keeping your Minecraft accounts online. Since it's hosted in the cloud, you can close your computer, and your accounts will remain active.

This saves you from running your computer 24/7, significantly reducing electricity costs. Additionally, you can manage your accounts from any device, anywhere - just log in via a browser.`

        title: "Why do I need a credit card?",
        content: `We use Stripe for secure payment processing. Stripe requires a credit card to verify your information and check for fraud. It matches the details you provide with your card and cross-references fraud databases.

If your payment is blocked, don't worry - contact us at admin@valoks.com or through our Discord server. We'll investigate the issue and help resolve it.`
